# ***Astro Venture***
**Astro Venture**, a 2d platformer game made in Godot(it's not ready yet, but you know it too). The concept is simple, you take your spaceship, fly to different planets, defeat different bosses, earn money, etc.

## *The Lore*
You are an average employee working for a company called RBSA(Random Broke Space Agency). RBSA's goal is to conquer the whole universe and then- nah I'm just kidding, their initial goal was to make rockets powerful enough to send whole families into space for the future. After 8 years, RBSA found out there was no profit in this field. They later set their goal to trick people into buying useless spaceships and then fly out to another country. And the spaceships weren't that cheap too! The average spaceship without any addons was ≈ $200M and with addons, up to $600M. There were three addons, each costing ≈ $200M depending on the type of spaceship.
- Extra thruster power
- More weight capacity (same as the 1st one)
- Extra safety (e.g. heat shields)
They earned $1B, in 10 years. They again went broke, but this time they fired 75% of the employees to cut costs.
